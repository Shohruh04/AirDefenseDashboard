I’m building a Computer Science diploma project called “3D Air Defense Simulation Dashboard.”

Goal: Create an educational, fully simulated dashboard for visualizing air defense system data — no real or government sources, only random/generated data.

Use **React.js**, **Three.js**, **Leaflet.js**, **Chart.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

🧩 Project Structure:
1. **App Layout**
   - Sidebar + top navbar + main content.
   - Tabs: “2D Map”, “3D Simulation”, “System Status”, “Analytics”, “Alerts”, “Settings”.
   - Navbar title: “3D Air Defense Simulation Dashboard (Educational Project)”.

2. **2D Map View (Leaflet.js)**
   - Show radar zones (short, medium, long).
   - Simulated aircraft markers updating every few seconds.
   - Randomized tooltips (ID, speed, altitude).

3. **3D Simulation (Three.js)**
   - 3D scene with Earth or flat terrain background.
   - Moving aircraft models (simple shapes or models).
   - Radar sweep animation using Three.js geometry + rotation.
   - Range spheres or cones for missile systems.
   - Ambient lighting, camera orbit controls, and smooth animation loop.
   - Allow toggle between “Day Mode” and “Night Mode” lighting.

4. **System Status**
   - Cards showing radar uptime, number of aircraft, simulated threat level, and system readiness.
   - Use Zustand or Context for state.

5. **Analytics**
   - Chart.js graphs:
     - Aircraft detections per minute.
     - Altitude distribution.
     - System load / readiness over time.

6. **Alerts Log**
   - Table listing simulated alerts like:
     - “Target detected: 48°N 71°E — Alt: 7500m — Type: Unknown”
   - Random generation every few seconds.

7. **Settings**
   - Buttons to start/stop simulation.
   - Slider to adjust data refresh rate.
   - Toggle between 2D/3D view modes.

8. **Simulation Data (simulation.js)**
   - Generate random aircraft data: ID, position, altitude, speed.
   - Randomly trigger “alert” events.
   - Handle updates every few seconds.
   - Store in global state (Zustand).

9. **About Page**
   - Clearly state:
     > “This project is a simulated educational dashboard. All visuals and data are artificially generated and do not represent real systems.”

10. **Tech Stack**
    - React + Vite
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Leaflet.js (for 2D map)
    - Three.js (for 3D visualization)
    - Chart.js (for analytics)
    - Zustand (for state management)

Expected output: A working React dashboard that visualizes simulated air defense data both in 2D and 3D, entirely educational and safe for public presentation.
